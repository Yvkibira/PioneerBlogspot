     <h1>How  to come up  with documentation in software engineering</h1> <p> Documentation is an essential feature of software engineering projects. It helps to ensure that the project is well-organized, maintainable, and scalable. Here are some tips for software engineering students on how to create documentation for their projects:<br>
<br>
1.Start with an overview  of the project scope and requirements  of the document. The document should outline the goals, objectives, and archeivements of the project proposed.<br>
<br>
2.Use a version control system such as<a href="https://git-scm.com/"> Git </a>to track changes to your project code and documentation.<br>
<br>
3.Create a README file that provides an executive overview of your project. This file should include information such as how to install and run the project, dependencies, and any other  information that is relevant.<br>
<br>
4. Show your code and  Use code comments to explain how your code works and why certain design decisions were made and barriers that were crossed.<br>
<br>
5.Write  a detailed technical documentation that covers the architecture, design, and implementation of your project. This documentation should be aimed at other developers who may need to maintain or extend your code in the future.<br>
<br>
6.Include diagrams, flowcharts, graphs and other visual aids to help explain the system architecture and design.<br>
<br>
7.Write user documentation that explains how to use your software. This documentation should be aimed at n users who  are not be familiar with the system.<br>
<br>
8.By following the above tips, software engineering students can create comprehensive documentation that helps to ensure the success of their projects.<br>
