     <h1>How to stop apps from auto starting on your laptop</h1><p>If you've ever experienced a slow startup or a laggy laptop, chances are that you have several apps running in the background, some of which are set to automatically start when you turn on your computer. While it can be useful to have some apps start automatically, such as antivirus software, many others can slow down your system, waste precious resources, and drain your laptop's battery life. In this article, we'll discuss how to stop apps from auto-starting on a laptop.<br>
<br>
Method 1: Using Task Manager (Windows)<br>
<br>
Step 1: Open Task Manager<br>
<br>
To open the Task Manager, right-click on the taskbar at the bottom of your screen and select "Task Manager" from the menu.<br>
<br>
Step 2: Go to the "Startup" tab
In the Task Manager, select the "Startup" tab.<br>
<br>
Step 3: Disable apps from auto-starting
You will see a list of all the apps that are set to start automatically. To stop an app from auto-starting, select it from the list and click on the "Disable" button at the bottom right corner of the window.<br>
<br>
Method 2: Using Settings<br>
<br>
Windows 10 also allows you to control which apps start automatically by using the Settings app. Here's how to do it:<br>
<br>
Step 1: Open Settings
Click on the Start menu and select "Settings" (the gear icon).<br>
<br>
Step 2: Navigate to Apps
In the Settings app, click on "Apps."<br>
<br>
Step 3: Navigate to Startup
Click on "Startup" in the left sidebar.<br>
<br>
Step 4: Disable the apps you don't want to start automatically
Toggle off the switch for the apps you want to disable from auto-starting.<br>
