     <h1>How to advertise  using instagram</h1>
     <p>If you are looking to promote your products on Instagram but don't know how to get started, this article will guide you through the process step by step.<br>
<br>
Firstly, open your Instagram app and log in to your account. Next, go to your profile and turn your account into a professional account by going to Settings, then Account, and clicking on "Add Professional Account."<br>
<br>
Once you've converted your account to a professional account, click on one of your posts, and alongside insights, you'll find a "Boost Post" button. Click on this button and select a goal for your ad. Next, let your target audience be automatic and select your budget and duration.<br>
<br>
Review your ad and select your payment method. If you don't have a credit card or your money is in Mpesa, don't worry. Follow this link to learn how to pay using <a href="how-to-pay-for-products-that-require-credit-cards-using-mpesa.html"> mpesa</a><br>
<br>
After your ad's duration is complete, you will notice that your account has not been deducted. Instagram will bill you the next month or when you breach a set limit. To settle your account, go to Settings, click on "Business," select "Ad Payment," click on "Payment Method," check your current balance and pay.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, promoting your products on Instagram is an effective way to reach a broad audience and drive sales. Follow these simple steps to create engaging Instagram ads and use the platform to your advantage.<br>
