     <h1>How to join  a political party  online in kenya</h1>
    <p>Students who are passionate about politics and want to actively engage in shaping the country's future can join a political party. Joining a political party provides a platform to contribute to policy-making, advocacy, and political campaigns. This article serves as a guide to help students understand the process and requirements for joining a political party in Kenya.</p>
    
    
  <ol>Before you get started
    <li>
    
      <p>A <b>political party</b> in Kenya is a legal entity with its own rights and responsibilities. It has the liberty to decide the criteria individuals need to satisfy to become a member. The party must specify the eligibility for membership in its constitution as required by the law.</p>
    </li>
   
    <li>
      <strong >Recruitment Process Elements</strong >
      <p>The party's recruitment process includes several key elements:</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Membership Recruitment Requirements: The party's constitution should clearly outline the requirements for membership recruitment.</li>
        <li>Membership Card: The party must introduce a standardized membership card.</li>
        <li>Member Verification Form: Both the party and the member must complete the member verification form.</li>
        <li>Membership List: The party should maintain and continuously update a membership list.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong >Roles of Party Members</strong >
      
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Mobilizing citizens for party support.</li>
        <li>Engaging with and educating citizens on policies.</li>
        <li>Recruiting and electing political party leaders.</li>
        <li>Nominating party candidates for general elections and by-elections.</li>

      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong >Membership Fees</strong >
      <p>Members are required to pay membership fees as determined by the party. These fees contribute to supporting party activities and administration.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
 <h2>Steps to join  a  political  party </h2>
      <b> Fill the  Membership Recruitment Forms</b>
      <p>Political parties use Party Membership Verification Forms to recruit members. These forms are filled out for each member and must be duly signed. Once a person's name is entered into the membership register, they become a member of the party.</p><br>
      examples:<br>
      <a href="https://members.uda.ke/">UDA</a><br>
      <a href="https://jubileeparty.ke/?page_id=17">JUBILEE</a><br>
      <a href="https://odm.co.ke/membership/">ODM</a><br>
    Search  for   membership  forms  online by visiting  any political  party's  website.
      <br>
    </li>
    
      <strong >Verify membership</strong >
      <p>Registering a person as a member of a political party without their consent is an offense. The party must maintain an updated and accurate party membership list, which should be accessible to both the members and the public. </p>

  <h2>Website Verification</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Visit the Office of Registrar of Political Parties website.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Click on "Check your membership status" in the right-hand corner.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If you are a registered voter, enter the national identification or passport number that you used for registration.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>SMS Shortcode Verification</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Dial *509# on your mobile phone.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Enter your identification number when prompted.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You will then be given two options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Checking party membership</li>
        <li>Deregistration from or Resignation to a party</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Select "Checking party membership" to proceed.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
