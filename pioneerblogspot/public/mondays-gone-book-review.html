     <h1> Monday's Gone by Nicci French book  review</h1>
  <br>  <p>Are you a fan of psychological thrillers? Then I highly recommend you read <em>Monday's Gone</em> by Nicci French, published by Penguin Publishing Group on the 4th of April 2013. The authors, Nicci Gerard and Sean French, did a good job on this one. I have never read any of their books but I've always wanted to and I finally did.</p><br>

<p>The novel is about the disappearance of five-year-old Jonna Vine and Michael Farraday, but their disappearances are 22 years apart. The prologue takes us through two sisters, Joanna and her big sister Rose, going home from school. Rose is irritated by how slow her younger sister is. She is the one responsible for her as their mother is not able to pick them up from school. She urges Joanna to walk faster and walks for quite a distance without looking back to see where she is. All this time she is thinking of how her sister is so annoying. She enters a sweet shop to buy candy and while there Rose bumps into one of her classmates, whom she thinks is cool and she wants to make a good impression. While they are talking, they mention her little sister, and at that time, she wonders what's taking her so long, so she goes to the door to check. She's nowhere to be seen. She looks at the place where she had last seen her and nothing. She panics and starts heading home, hoping that Joanna had headed home without her. On arrival, she's met by her mother who asks her where her sister is, and that's when it dawns on her that her sister is lost. They head to the police station to report. The police, however, do not find her. The same case repeats itself 22 years later but this time with a red-headed boy of almost the same age. They both go missing in the same manner—while going home from school.</p><br>

<p>A psychiatrist by the name Frieda Klein is intrigued by the case of the missing boy based on a session she had with one of her new clients. Is the new client implicated in the disappearance of the boy, or is there another explanation? Could it just be a mere coincidence that the client was dreaming of having a son with the same physical characteristics as the missing boy, not forgetting the fact that the client cannot have children of his own? Could the two cases, 22 years apart, be connected? Frieda Klein dives into unraveling the mystery of the two cases to find out what really happened to the two—most importantly the whereabouts of the recently missing boy, Michael Farraday. The book is full of twists and turns that you could not imagine, and the way the story unravels is just wonderful. It will leave you hungry for more. Luckily for you, the book is part of a series and on finishing it will leave you excited to go to the next book—<em>Tuesday's Gone</em>. I know I am.</p><br>
